=head1 File::Spec::Native

This module is a stupid hack to make the default L<File::Spec> behavior
available from a subclass.  This can be useful when using another module
that expects a subclass of L<File::Spec> but you want to use
the current, native OS format (automatically detected by L<File::Spec>).

See module POD for more information.
